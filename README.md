Just a repository to backup my work in case the BBB fails.

# Notes

I don't know why, but the max(Packet Size) I can send is 20-bytes. Also, it seems that the Program Data command *must* be preceded by a Send Data command. 

**Payload Size = 137 and Packet Size = 20**

time = 1 minute 17.311 seconds

**Payload Size = 270 and Packet Size = 20**

time = 1 minute 4.944 seconds
